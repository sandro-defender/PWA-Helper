## React Bits components

The following component sources are vendored from
[React Bits](https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits), by David Haz, and are now
owned/maintained as part of this example application:

| Component | Local source | Upstream variant | Runtime dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ElectricLogo | `src/ElectricLogo.jsx`, `src/ElectricLogo.css` | JavaScript + CSS | `ogl` (already present) |
| SpotlightCard | `src/react-bits/SpotlightCard.tsx`, `.css` | TypeScript + CSS | none |
| GlareHover | `src/react-bits/GlareHover.tsx`, `.css` | TypeScript + CSS | none |
| LatticeLoader | `src/react-bits/LatticeLoader.tsx`, `.css` | TypeScript + CSS | none |

The TypeScript + CSS variants were selected to match the requested TypeScript
preference and the project's plain-CSS conventions. Official installation
documentation recommends copying component source into the project (or using
`shadcn`/`jsrepo`); no React Bits npm package is installed. Local adaptations:
removal of the Next.js-specific `'use client'` directive, safe
`window.matchMedia?.()` access, reduced-motion overrides for the decorative
highlights/glare/loader, and design-token overrides in `example.css`. See
[`DESIGN_FOUNDATION.md`](../DESIGN_FOUNDATION.md) for the full adoption report.

`src/ElectricLogo.jsx` depends on `ogl`. The three new TypeScript components add
**no runtime dependencies**; `typescript`, `@types/react` and
`@types/react-dom` are dev-only, isolated in `example/`, and used by
`npm run typecheck`.

The upstream repository applies the following license to all of the above
sources:
