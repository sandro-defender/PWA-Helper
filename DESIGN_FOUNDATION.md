# Design Skill + React Bits — Application Record

This is the required report for the **ui-ux-pro-max-skill** and the official
**React Bits** integration. It records exactly where the skill's instructions
were read, which searches were run, how the results influenced concrete code,
and which React Bits components were inspected, adopted or rejected.

---

## 1. Mandatory design skill: where it was found and read

No pre-installed copy existed in this repository or in the sandbox home, so the
skill was read from its **documented installation location in the official
repository**:

- Repository: <https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill>
- Skill instructions: `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md`
- Supporting rules read: `references/quick-reference.md`,
  `references/pro-rules.md` (including its canonical Pre-Delivery Checklist)
- Search tool: `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py`
- Official README install path: `uipro init --ai universal` installs to
  `.agents/skills/`; `--ai claude` installs to `.claude/skills/`; `--global`
  installs to `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill itself says to invoke `search.py`
  by its full path and to treat results as recommendations, never as
  instructions that override the repository.

A shallow clone of the official repository was made **outside** the project
(`/tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`) so no skill data or generated catalog is committed
into this repository. Only the small, curated
[`design-system/you-ge-assistant/MASTER.md`](design-system/you-ge-assistant/MASTER.md)
is persisted.

### Stack detection (SKILL.md Step 1)

`example/package.json` declares React 19 + React DOM + Vite 8 and **plain CSS**
(no Tailwind). The core toolkit (`pwa.js`, `progressier.js`,
`domain-config.js`, `dns-diagnostics.js`) is dependency-free classic JavaScript
with no build step. Therefore React guidance was applied only to `example/`;
`--stack react` was used for the sample, and no Tailwind variant was chosen.

### Commands actually executed

```bash
# First design-system attempt (REJECTED after fit verification — see below)
python3 /tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \
  "developer infrastructure dashboard premium modern" --design-system \
  -p "You.Ge Assistant" --variance 5 --motion 3 --density 6 -f markdown \
  --persist --output-dir /home/user/PWA-Helper

# Verified-fit design system (persisted to design-system/you-ge-assistant/MASTER.md)
python3 /tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \
  "developer tooling SaaS dashboard technical minimal" --design-system \
  -p "You.Ge Assistant" --variance 4 --motion 2 --density 7 -f markdown \
  --persist --output-dir /home/user/PWA-Helper

# Targeted UX / stack searches
python3 .../search.py "reduced motion accessible animation" --domain ux -n 5
python3 .../search.py "status indicator loading feedback" --domain ux -n 5
python3 .../search.py "modal focus trap keyboard close" --domain ux -n 4
python3 .../search.py "touch target size 44px" --domain ux -n 4
python3 .../search.py "effect cleanup reduced motion" --stack react -n 4
```

**Fit verification:** the first query returned *Liquid Glass* + a
Cormorant/Montserrat luxury palette and scroll-triggered storytelling. That does
not match a developer-infrastructure product, would add an external Google Fonts
request, and its "premium" interpretation conflicts with a technical tool. It
was **rejected and regenerated**; `MASTER.md` now contains the verified
`SaaS (General)` / Glassmorphism result with Plus Jakarta Sans, motion 2/10,
density 7/10. The palette/font replacement itself was also **not applied**: the
existing example already has a coherent green brand and system-font stack, and
SKILL.md explicitly says search results are recommendations that must not
override repository rules. The applied subset is the accessibility, motion,
feedback, hierarchy and responsive guidance.

## 2. Exactly how the skill influenced the work

| Skill rule (source) | Concrete change in this PR |
| --- | --- |
| **Priority 1 — Accessibility**: contrast 4.5:1, visible focus, aria-labels, no removed focus rings (`SKILL.md`, `quick-reference.md` §1) | `pwa.js` install sheet: added `:focus-visible` rings for close/primary buttons, `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby`, descriptive close label, contrast-safe `.note` color `#475569` with no 0.7 opacity. `pwa.css`: restored a visible `:focus-visible` ring over the legacy banner's `outline: 0 !important`. New React UI uses inline SVG with `aria-hidden`, `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-busy`, `aria-describedby`. |
| **Priority 2 — Touch & interaction**: 44px targets, 8px spacing, `touch-action`, feedback (`quick-reference.md` §2) | Install sheet close target raised to 44×44 with `touch-action: manipulation`; new CTA/empty-state buttons have `min-height: 44px` and ≥8px gaps; disabled empty-state action is visibly non-interactive. Existing Escape/backdrop/focus-restore behavior is preserved. |
| **Priority 3 — Performance**: lazy loading, no CLS, no layout thrash (`SKILL.md` priority table) | Three adopted components are CSS/DOM-only with **zero runtime dependencies**; `SpotlightCard` runs with `ambient={false}`, `flare={false}`, `grain={0}`, proximity-limited rAF, and cleans up observers/listeners. `LatticeLoader` appears only during a 320ms capability check. No new WebGL, shader, font or network request. Static HTML fallback prevents invisible content. |
| **Priority 4/6 — Style, typography and color**: consistency, semantic tokens, no emoji icons (`MASTER.md`, `pro-rules.md`) | New UI reuses `--brand`, `--surface`, `--muted`, `--line`, `--shadow` tokens and one SVG icon family with consistent 1.75 stroke; no emoji or mixed icon styles; status conveyed by text **and** dot, never color alone. |
| **Priority 5 — Layout & responsive**: mobile-first, no horizontal scroll (`quick-reference.md` §5) | `.foundation-grid` uses `repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))`, collapses to one column at 900px, controls go full-width at 600px; `.foundation-section` uses `min(100% - 32px, 1120px)`. |
| **Priority 7 — Animation**: motion conveys meaning, reduced motion (`ux` search: "Reduced Motion", "Excessive Motion", "Continuous Animation", "Duration Timing") | One 180ms panel entrance, one 180ms connection toast, 160ms color transitions only. `example.css` global reduced-motion rule, inline `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:reduce)` in the shadow-DOM sheet, and reduced-motion overrides in **all three** vendored stylesheets. `SpotlightCard`'s internal `reduce` flag and `GlareHover`'s `reduced` guard are retained. No continuous decorative animation. |
| **Priority 8 — Forms & feedback**: loading feedback, `aria-busy`, progressive disclosure (`ux` search: "Loading Indicators", "Submit Feedback") | `LatticeLoader` + `aria-busy` while capabilities are read; `role="status"` connection line; notification toast with `aria-live="polite"`; empty state explains why the action is disabled. |
| **Priority 9 — Navigation**: predictable, deep-linkable, no overloaded nav | The existing two-link native nav was kept. The floating assistant panel gained a subtle 180ms entrance, retains `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`, Escape/outside-click close and focus restoration. |
| **React stack guidance**: clean up effects, correct dependencies (`--stack react`) | `FoundationPreview.tsx` and `useOnlineStatus` in `main.jsx` return cleanups for `setTimeout` and `online`/`offline` listeners, with correct dependency arrays. |

**Pre-delivery checklist (`pro-rules.md`):** applied for this web surface —
no emoji icons, consistent SVG strokes, `cursor: pointer` on controls, visible
focus, reduced motion, 375/768/1024/1440 responsive intent, stable hover states
without layout shift, and semantic tokens. Native 44pt/48dp and safe-area rules
are documented as platform-specific and were not misapplied as a universal web
conformance claim (`quick-reference.md` `web-target-size`: 24 CSS px minimum;
we use 44px where practical).

## 3. React Bits: official documentation read

- <https://reactbits.dev/get-started/introduction> — 217 components in five
  categories; four flavours (`JS-CSS`, `JS-TW`, `TS-CSS`, `TS-TW`); principles
  *You own the code*, *Props first*, *Nothing to depend on*, *Your stack*;
  "Use motion with care" (two or three effects per page, plan for mobile, test
  real devices); MIT + Commons Clause license.
- <https://reactbits.dev/get-started/installation> — install source with
  `npx shadcn@latest add @react-bits/<Name>-TS-CSS` or
  `npx jsrepo@latest add https://reactbits.dev/r/<Name>-TS-CSS`, or copy the
  Code tab source by hand and install only that component's dependencies.
  React Bits is **not** an npm package.
- <https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits> — official source, registry JSON
  (`public/r/<Name>-TS-CSS.json`) and `LICENSE.md`.

The TS-CSS flavour was chosen to match the TypeScript preference and the
project's existing plain-CSS conventions. Sources were copied into
`example/src/react-bits/` and are owned here; no CLI or component-collection
dependency was added.

## 4. Components inspected, adopted and rejected

| Component | Registry dependencies | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ElectricLogo** | `ogl@^1.0.11` | Already adopted before this PR, retained | Existing floating assistant launcher. WebGL cost is isolated to one widget and already has reduced-motion, IntersectionObserver and cleanup handling. |
| **SpotlightCard** (TS-CSS) | none | **Adopted** | Pointer/keyboard-focus-driven card highlight for the three foundation cards; no continuous animation, respects reduced motion, cleans up listeners. |
| **GlareHover** (TS-CSS) | none | **Adopted** | One subtle hover/focus sweep on the install CTA; `mode="hover"`, `playOnce`, reduced-motion guard. Not a loop. |
| **LatticeLoader** (TS-CSS) | none | **Adopted** | Accessible `role="status"` loading indicator for the short capability check; infinite animation is a loading indicator only, and our local CSS stops it under reduced motion. |
| FadeContent, AnimatedContent, ScrollReveal, StaggeredMenu | `gsap@^3.13.0` | Not used | Would add a new runtime animation dependency for effects we can achieve with 160–180ms CSS. |
| StatusMark, SwipeToast | `motion@^12.23.12` (+ hugeicons for SwipeToast) | Not used | New runtime dependency; status/toast needs are met with text + SVG + `aria-live` and existing CSS. |
| Stepper, FlowingMenu, AnimatedList | `@hugeicons/react`, `@hugeicons/core-free-icons` | Not used | Icon-library dependencies and large sources for a read-only preview with no wizard/list data. |
| PillNav, GooeyNav, BubbleMenu, CardNav | none (but 22–31 KB source each) | Not used | The current navigation is two native anchors; replacing it with a large animated nav would add complexity and risk without material UX gain. |
| BorderGlow, StarBorder, PixelCard, HoloCard, ClickSpark, SpecularButton, BounceCards | none | Not used | Decorative continuous glows, canvas spark effects or oversized button choreography. `SKILL.md` "Continuous Animation" and React Bits "two or three per page" argue against them here. |
| Aurora, Balatro, Galaxy, DarkVeil and other shader/canvas backgrounds | varies (`ogl`, `three`, `three`) | Not used | Explicitly excluded: no excessive 3D/WebGL/shader effects or continuously running backgrounds. |
| Tailwind (`*-TS-TW`) variants | — | Not used | This example uses plain CSS; introducing Tailwind would be a new styling system. |

## 5. Dependencies introduced and why

| Dependency | Where | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none (runtime) | core toolkit and example | SpotlightCard, GlareHover, LatticeLoader have empty `dependencies` in their official registry entries. The core toolkit stays dependency-free. |
| `typescript@^5.9.3` | `example/` devDependencies | Required for `tsc --noEmit` over the TS-CSS React Bits sources — satisfies "prefer TypeScript" and adds a real type-check gate. |
| `@types/react@^19`, `@types/react-dom@^19` | `example/` devDependencies | Type declarations for React 19 TSX; dev-only, not bundled. |
| existing `react`, `react-dom`, `vite`, `ogl` | `example/` | Unchanged from before this PR. |

`example/package-lock.json` was updated for these dev dependencies. The root
`package.json` still has no dependencies. No component-collection package, CLI,
GSAP, Motion, HugeIcons, Tailwind or WebGL library was installed.

## 6. Performance and accessibility considerations

- **Performance:** three lightweight DOM/CSS components instead of a component
  collection; 21 KB of new JS bundle (315 KB total, ~99 KB gzip for the
  example); no new runtime network requests, fonts or shaders; rAF work is
  proximity-limited and settles; observers and listeners are disconnected on
  unmount; the only continuously animating element is the short-lived loader.
- **Reduced motion:** vendored CSS overrides disable the spotlight, glare and
  loader loop; `example.css` has a global `prefers-reduced-motion` rule; the
  shadow-DOM install sheet disables its new transitions. Essential content and
  all controls work without any animation.
- **Accessibility:** visible focus rings (including the legacy banner that had
  `outline: 0 !important`), 44px min targets where practical, descriptive labels,
  `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal` preserved, focus restoration preserved, SVG icons
  `aria-hidden` with text alternatives, status conveyed by text as well as color,
  `aria-live="polite"` toasts that do not steal focus, disabled action explained
  via `aria-describedby`, and a static no-JS HTML fallback.
- **Responsive:** single-column cards below 900px, full-width actions below
  600px, no fixed pixel container widths, no horizontal scroll.

## 7. Files influenced by the skill / React Bits

- `pwa.js` — install help sheet focus, contrast, touch target, semantics.
- `pwa.css` — banner focus ring and reduced-motion transition rule.
- `example/src/react-bits/*` — vendored, locally adapted TS-CSS sources.
- `example/src/FoundationPreview.tsx` — cards, loading, empty state, status,
  notification and CTA composition.
- `example/src/main.jsx` — panel status/transition, effect cleanup, mount.
- `example/index.html` — static fallback and foundation section.
- `example/example.css` — tokens, responsive layout, reduced motion.
- `example/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `example/README.md`, `example/tsconfig.json`,
  `example/package.json`, `.github/workflows/check.yml` — ownership, license,
  TypeScript and CI gates.
- `design-system/you-ge-assistant/MASTER.md` — persisted verified design system.
- `FOUNDATION_AUDIT.md`, `ASSISTANT_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `INSTALLATION_EXPERIENCE.md` — design and UX constraints recorded as
  architecture/security requirements.

The design skill guided hierarchy, consistency, accessibility and responsive
behavior; React Bits supplied the reusable card, CTA and loading source. Neither
overrode the existing application's technical requirements: the PWA install flow
was audited first and its behavior is unchanged.

## 8. Intelligent Floating Assistant (Phase 1.5)

The floating Assistant was added as a core widget on the same working branch.
The mandatory `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` was applied again; exact searches are
recorded in [`WIDGET.md`](WIDGET.md) §6. The official React Bits installation
docs were re-read at <https://reactbits.dev/get-started/installation> (source
ownership, per-component dependencies, TS-CSS variant by hand).

### Adopted again, zero new dependencies

| Component | New use | Local adaptation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GlareHover` | Hover-only feedback around the React example's floating launcher. | `mode="hover"`, `playOnce`; root `overflow: visible` and a circular `clip-path` on the glare so the existing ElectricLogo stage is not clipped. Reduced-motion override retained. |
| `SpotlightCard` | Connection-status card inside the Assistant panel. | Light theme, `ambient=false`, `flare=false`, `grain=0`, project tokens override the vendored skin; reduced-motion override retained. |
| `LatticeLoader` | Bounded diagnostics "checking" state. | Rendered only while `network.dns.status === 'running'`; `role="status"`, reduced-motion override retained. |

`example/src/main.jsx` now consumes `window.YouGeAssistant` through
`useSyncExternalStore`, so the React example and the dependency-free
`assistant-widget.js` renderer share one state model. No GSAP, Motion,
HugeIcons, Tailwind, shaders, continuous WebGL backgrounds or component
collections were added. The existing `ElectricLogo`/`ogl` launcher is retained in
the example, but only as interaction feedback: it mounts on hover/focus or while
the panel is open, never idles in a loop, is clipped to the button's circle, and
follows the same actionable-tone rule as the widget fill. The widget itself still
introduces no WebGL effect.

### Skill influence on the widget UI

- **Accessibility CRITICAL:** one `role="status" aria-live="polite"` region with
  a complete contextual phrase; labelled FAB, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`,
  Escape/close route, focus restoration, 3px `:focus-visible` outlines.
- **Touch CRITICAL:** 56px launcher, 44px controls, 8px gaps,
  `cursor: pointer`, `touch-action: manipulation`, press feedback,
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)` offsets; playground uses `bottom-left` to avoid the
  existing toolbox.
- **Performance HIGH:** one stable snapshot, deferred classic scripts, no
  polling, no `fetch`, no duplicate SW registration, offline-shell precache.
- **Style/layout HIGH:** consistent inline SVG icon set (no emoji), semantic
  tokens, single elevation scale, 480px clamp, `100dvh` max-height, no
  horizontal scroll, light/dark tokens defined together.
- **Animation/feedback MEDIUM:** shared motion tokens (160ms feedback, 240ms
  state change) instead of one duration everywhere, no looping badge or
  bounce, `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` fallback, empty state,
  progressive-disclosure recovery guidance.
- **Pre-delivery checklist:** 375/768/1024/1440px responsive contracts, 4.5:1
  contrast tokens, visible focus, descriptive labels, no obscured focus.

The `--design-system` query again returned the SaaS/General direction already
persisted in `MASTER.md`. Its Glassmorphism, Google Font and GSAP scroll-reveal
suggestions were deliberately rejected: the repository uses system fonts and
plain CSS, and the user excluded unnecessary dependencies and heavy animation.
`MASTER.md` was not overwritten (no `--force`).

### Files influenced

`assistant-state.js`, `assistant-widget.js`, `assistant-widget.css`,
`example/src/main.jsx`, `example/example.css`, `example/index.html`,
`demo/index.html`, `offline.html`, `offline.js`, `snippet.html`,
`progressier.js`, `example/vite.config.js`, `.github/workflows/pages.yml`,
`.github/workflows/check.yml`, `scripts/check.mjs`,
`tests/assistant-widget.test.mjs`, `WIDGET.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `ASSISTANT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `example/README.md`,
`example/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## 9. Phase 2 — `@youge/assistant-sdk` extraction and developer UX

### Skill resources consulted and queries executed

Read directly from `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`:
- `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/references/quick-reference.md`
- `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/references/pro-rules.md`

Executed targeted search queries with `python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py`:
- `--domain ux` (`developer sdk documentation progressive disclosure status feedback`) → surfaced `error-recovery`, `touch-target-size`, `form-labels`
- `--domain product` (`developer sdk infrastructure tool`) → matched `Developer Tool / IDE` (clean hierarchy, calm contrast, scannable progressive disclosure, zero visual noise)
- `--stack react` (`useSyncExternalStore hook state subscription cleanup`) → surfaced `useEffectCleanup` (`removeEventListener` + unsubscribe symmetry on teardown) and `memo-deps`
- `--domain react` (`external store state subscription re-render`) → surfaced `rerender-defer-reads` (subscribe only to needed slices; memoize selector snapshots so unchanged renders stay O(1))

### How guidance influenced Phase 2 implementation

1. **Tear-free React external-store ergonomics (`@youge/assistant-sdk/react`):**
   Applied `useEffectCleanup` and `rerender-defer-reads` to `getExternalStoreBindings()` and `createUseAssistant()`. Selector results are cached against `(lastState, lastSelected)` with `Object.is`, preventing spurious React 18/19 re-renders and infinite selector loops while keeping `react` completely out of SDK runtime dependencies.
2. **Live, calm SDK telemetry in `example/src/FoundationPreview.tsx` & `example/src/main.jsx`:**
   Kept the verified calm SaaS/Developer-Tool visual hierarchy from `MASTER.md` and the already-vendored zero-dependency TS-CSS React Bits components (`SpotlightCard`, `GlareHover`, `LatticeLoader`) without visual churn. Wired both `main.jsx` and `FoundationPreview.tsx` directly to `@youge/assistant-sdk` and `@youge/assistant-sdk/react` so the live status bar (`role="status"`) and Resilience card surface real SDK state (`SDK v0.1.0`, active origin, live install capability, and resolved config source `defaults | overrides | published | last-known-good`) while preserving the static no-JS HTML fallback, inline SVG icons, 44px touch targets, and `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`.
3. **Progressive-disclosure developer documentation (`packages/assistant-sdk/README.md`):**
   Structured SDK docs from immediate 30-second Quick Start (`YouGeAssistant.create`, `YouGeAssistant.attach`, optional React hook) → subpath table → configuration/LKG security pipeline → complete method/priority tables → illustrative generic host integration, with explicit non-goals and unpublished-package transparency.


## 10. Phase 3 — release preparation & documentation DX (2026-11-06)

No visual/UI surface changed in this phase (no widget, example or stylesheet
edits); the mandatory `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` was applied to **developer
experience**: SDK documentation, release/migration guides and the validation
tool's feedback design.

### Skill resources consulted and queries executed

Read directly from `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`
(clone at `/tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`, not committed):
- `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md` (query contract, workflow, priority table)
- `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/references/pro-rules.md` (pre-delivery checklist)

Executed targeted search queries with `python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py`:
- `--domain ux` (`developer sdk documentation progressive disclosure status feedback`) → "Submit Feedback — show loading then success/error state" (every command documents its success signal and failure exit); "Heading Line Balance" (bounded measures, no forced breaks)
- `--domain product` (`developer sdk infrastructure tool error message documentation`) → matched **API Developer Portal** ("Quick Start + Interactive Docs", scannable hierarchy) and **Developer Tool / IDE** ("Minimal & Direct + Documentation")

### How guidance influenced the release-preparation deliverables

1. **Progressive disclosure in `packages/assistant-sdk/README.md`:** status box
   first (what is true *now* — unpublished, publishing disabled), then
   installation in two clearly separated contexts (registry "after the first
   approved release" vs. local `file:`), with deep policy (semver, registry
   decision, runbook) deferred to `RELEASE.md`/`MIGRATION.md` links.
2. **Scannable decision tables in `RELEASE.md`:** the GitHub Packages vs public
   npm comparison follows the "Quick Start + Interactive Docs" pattern —
   recommendation and its reasons before the exhaustive table; the three
   publishing locks get an explicit status table instead of prose.
3. **Atomic, observable runbook steps in `RELEASE.md` §4 and `MIGRATION.md`
   §4–5:** each step is one action with its success signal (per "Submit
   Feedback": never leave a step without an observable outcome); the migration
   checklist items are all machine-checkable ("grep finds no vendored-path
   imports", "YouGeAssistant.version equals the pin").
4. **Status feedback in `scripts/validate-package.mjs`:** sectioned
   PASS/FAIL/NOTE output mirrors the skill's feedback-loop rule — every check
   reports a state, the summary repeats the package identity and next action
   ("ready for the release checklist — publishing still disabled"), and exit
   codes make it CI-usable.
5. **Pre-delivery checklist applied to the docs themselves:** prerequisites
   named but never invented (npm scope ownership), secrets never printed,
   rollback documented first-class in `MIGRATION.md` §6.

## 11. Package rename to `@youge/assistant-sdk` — documentation consistency (2026-11-06)

No visual surface changed; the mandatory `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` was applied to
**documentation and developer-facing consistency** during the package rename.

### Skill resources consulted and queries executed

Read from `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` (fresh clone at
`/tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`, never committed):
- `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md` (query contract: one dominant intent
  per query, verify domain/fit before applying)

Executed with `python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py`:
- `--domain ux` (`documentation consistency naming change migration status`) →
  "Submit Feedback — confirm status with loading → success/error state" and
  "Contextual Live Badge Updates — one atomic contextual message, not bare
  numbers"
- `--domain product` (`developer sdk infrastructure tool documentation`) →
  **API Developer Portal** ("Quick Start + Interactive Docs") and
  **Knowledge Base/Documentation** ("clean hierarchy, minimal noise")

### How guidance was applied

1. **Atomic, status-reporting rename steps (Submit Feedback):** every rename
   step reported its verification state immediately — registry gate checks,
   per-file replacement counts, `sync:sdk --check`, lockfile regeneration —
   never a silent bulk edit. The PR progress comment reports results as
   contextual sentences ("86 of 86 identity references migrated, 2 intentional
   history mentions remain"), not bare checkmarks.
2. **Consistency as an observable outcome (Contextual updates):** the
   definition of "done" for the rename is a repo-wide grep result, stated in
   the PR and `RELEASE.md` §6 as one atomic status message.
3. **Quick Start + Interactive Docs kept truthful (API Developer Portal):**
   the README's install snippet, subpath table and import examples all now
   show `@youge/assistant-sdk` first-try-correct — a developer copying from any
   code block must never hit a 404 from a stale name.
4. **Clean hierarchy for the identity decision (Knowledge Base):** `RELEASE.md`
   §2 leads with a small identity table (user → org → scope → package) before
   the verification prose, so the confirmed identity is scannable at a glance.

## 12. 0.1.0 release preparation — release docs & installation DX (2026-11-06)

The mandatory `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` was applied to the **release documentation
and the developer installation experience** (no visual surface changed).

### Skill resources consulted and queries executed

Read from `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` (clone at
`/tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`, not committed): `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md`
(query contract and priority table).

Executed with `python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py`:
- `--domain ux` (`getting started install onboarding setup status`) → *User
  Freedom* (no forced linear tour), *Submit Feedback* (confirm status with
  explicit success/error states), *Contextual Live Badge Updates* (one atomic
  meaningful status, not bare markers)
- `--domain product` (`developer sdk release documentation changelog`) →
  **Changelog / Release Notes** ("Timeline + Version List" pattern,
  version + date headings), **API Developer Portal** ("Quick Start +
  Interactive Docs")

### How guidance was applied

1. **Installation first-try-correct (API Developer Portal / User Freedom):**
   the README leads with the exact `npm install @youge/assistant-sdk@0.1.0`
   command and keeps registry vs local consumption as two clearly-labeled
   fast paths — a consumer never has to read the release runbook to install.
2. **Atomic status per runbook step (Submit Feedback):** every RELEASE.md §4
   step now carries its own explicit status (`DONE`, `to be dispatched`,
   `OWNER ACTION`, `NOT DONE`) — no step leaves the reader guessing what
   happened.
3. **One contextual status sentence (Contextual updates):** the README status
   box and RELEASE.md banner state the release condition as a single precise
   sentence — "release-ready but **not yet published**; publication is the
   owner's runbook steps 3–5" — instead of bare flags.
4. **Version-list changelog pattern (Changelog / Release Notes):** the new
   `## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-06 (initial release)` section uses the product-type
   pattern (version + date heading, grouped scannable bullets: API, config,
   architecture, packaging, release engineering) above the running
   *Unreleased* log.

### Phase 4 — npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) migration (2026-11-06)

The `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` was consulted for the OIDC migration. Its "When to
Apply" section directs skipping the skill for infrastructure/DevOps work that
does not change how something looks, feels, moves or is interacted with, so the
`--design-system` / `--domain` / `--stack` search workflow was **not** run —
no UI surface changed, and none may change for this infrastructure-only task.
The skill's documentation guidance was applied instead: `RELEASE.md` §6 leads
with requirements, uses scannable decision tables, keeps runbook steps atomic
with explicit guard/failure states, and the migration is recorded as an atomic
changelog entry above the version log. Skill instructions read from
`https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`
(`.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md`); no skill data or generated catalog is
committed.

## 13. First-publication GitHub Actions staging (2026-11-06)

The `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` instructions were located and read for this phase:
the repository's own references (`AGENTS.md` — *"the `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` is
mandatory for interface changes"* — and `DESIGN_FOUNDATION.md` §10–§12, plus
`WIDGET.md` §`ui-ux-pro-max-skill`), and the skill's `SKILL.md` from
`https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` (clone not
committed).

**Applicability decision (following the skill's own guidance):** its *When to
Apply* section says to skip the skill for *infrastructure/DevOps work that does
not change how something looks, feels, moves or is interacted with*. This task
— a GitHub Actions staging job, release-gate tests and runbook updates — is
exactly that: no UI surface was added, changed or removed, and none may change.
The skill's `--design-system` / `--domain` / `--stack` search workflow was
therefore **not run**, consistent with the recorded decision for the OIDC
migration (§10, *Phase 4*).

**Documentation guidance applied instead** (the same pattern as §10/§12): status
first (the RELEASE.md banner leads with *staged or published?* state), scannable
decision/verification tables (§6.1 requirements, §7 implementation-pass table),
atomic runbook steps with explicit per-step `Status:` guard states (§4 steps
3–9), and explicit failure/guard wording in the workflow header (what the stage
job can and cannot do, placeholder behaviour, revocation). No skill data or
generated catalog was committed.

## 14. OIDC trusted-publishing staging migration (2026-11-07)

The `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` was again evaluated against its *When to Apply*
section for this phase: migrating the release workflow's staging job from a
temporary `NPM_STAGE_TOKEN` secret to npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — workflow
permissions, validator/contract/test updates and runbook/status-doc wording —
is infrastructure/DevOps work with **no UI surface change**, so the skill's
`--design-system` / `--domain` / `--stack` search workflow was **not run**,
consistent with the recorded decisions in §10 (Phase 4) and §13.

**Documentation guidance applied instead** (same pattern as §10/§13): status
first (RELEASE.md banner leads with *published 0.1.0 + token-free OIDC* state),
scannable tables (§6.1 requirements rows, §6.3 trusted-publisher connection +
48-hour window, §7 migration-pass verification table), atomic runbook steps
kept their per-step `Status:` guard states — now marked DONE for the
bootstrap/revoke steps and OWNER ACTION for the trusted-publisher
registration — and explicit guard wording in the workflow header (exact stage
permissions, token-free authentication, never publish/approve/reject). The
first-publication bootstrap is recorded as *created, used and revoked*, and the
staged-publish-counts-as-first-publish question is documented **UNVERIFIED**
until tested. No skill data or generated catalog was committed.

## 15. 0.1.1 feature release — Android Chrome handoff + floating-icon auto-scale/manual adjust (2026-11-07)

The `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` *When to Apply* section **was applied** for this
phase: both features change how the interface looks, behaves and is interacted
with (new offer banner, new panel section, responsive launcher sizing), so the
skill's search workflow was run from a throwaway clone
(`/tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`, not committed — per §1 header policy):

```bash
python3 /tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \
  "floating action button touch target safe area" --domain ux -n 3
python3 /tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \
  "range slider visible label accessible" --domain ux -n 3
python3 /tmp/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \
  "in app browser redirect user consent" --domain ux -n 3
```

**Where the results landed:**

- **Touch target size (High):** every new control clears the web floor with
  margin — widget ranges and the *Adjust icon* summary are `min-height: 44px`,
  offer/adjust gaps are 8px (`touch-spacing`), example handoff buttons are
  40px. No hover-only affordances (`reliance on hover only` anti-pattern).
- **Back button / history (High):** the Chrome handoff never touches session
  history — no `pushState`, no `location.replace`, no automatic navigation;
  `intent://` runs only on an explicit button press and falls back to manual
  steps when it cannot leave the app (navigation-preservation intent behind
  the *Back Button* rule).
- **Input labels (High):** every range has a visible `<label for>` above it
  plus a live `<output>` value — never placeholder-as-label.
- **Compact control semantics (Critical):** native `<button>` and
  `<input type="range">` only (no clickable divs), with 3px `:focus-visible`
  outlines on summary, ranges and offer buttons.
- **Reduced motion (High):** no new `@keyframes`, no `animation:`, and no
  width/height transitions (the existing fab transition contract keeps
  holding); the reduced-motion block stays intact and the offer/adjust UI is
  state-change-only.

**Documentation guidance applied** (same status-first pattern as §10/§14):
RELEASE.md banner now leads with *0.1.1 prepared, NOT staged/published* while
keeping every wording-test phrase; SDK README gains a feature section +
handoff API table + `chromeHandoff` config; WIDGET.md §4/§5/§7/§8 document the
tiers, adjustment storage keys, offer flow, new tests and the one pathological
`#Intent;` hash limitation; CHANGELOG folds the OIDC Unreleased section into
`## 0.1.1 — 2026-11-07` with both feature entries on top.

**Files influenced:** `assistant-widget.js` (offer + adjust section,
persistence, focus preservation), `assistant-widget.css` (`--youge-fab-size`
tiers, panel-gap token, `.youge-chrome-offer` + `.youge-adjust` blocks),
`example/src/main.jsx` + `example/example.css` (React handoff banner),
`packages/assistant-sdk/src/browser/` (new module + types), SDK
`index.js`/`index.d.ts`/`config`/`assistant`/`react` wiring,
`scripts/sync-sdk-browser.mjs` + `assistant-state.js` (bundle), tests
(`sdk-browser` new, widget/example-ui/sdk-core/sdk-config-security extended),
`scripts/check.mjs` (15 new contracts + 0.1.1 gate). No skill data or
generated catalog was committed.
