# You.Ge Assistant integration and migration guide

This checklist applies to any host or subdomain. Use examples such as
`app.example.com` or `/portal/`; no domain is assumed by the runtime. Existing
installations remain compatible with the `/progressier.js` worker URL and
legacy storage keys.

## 1. Upload files

Copy the runtime files into the application root (or the app's scoped public
folder):

```text
pwa.js pwa.css progressier.js manifest.webmanifest qrcode.js
domain-config.js domain-registry.js dns-diagnostics.js manifest-handler.js
offline.html offline.css offline.js browserconfig.xml favicon.ico icons/
```

On Cloudflare Pages, retain `functions/manifest.webmanifest.js` and the shared
`manifest-handler.js` at project root if using the dynamic host-aware manifest.
Static-only hosts should publish a separate manifest per brand or use the safe
You.Ge Assistant fallback manifest.

## 2. Configure domains and subdomains

Register public overrides in `domain-registry.js` before loading the resolver.
Exact hostname keys and optional path-scoped keys (for example,
`example.com/portal/`) take precedence over `*.example.com` patterns. Add identity,
metadata, colors, icons, start URL, scope/base path, shortcuts and feature toggles
as needed. See [`MULTI_DOMAIN.md`](MULTI_DOMAIN.md) for a complete example.

Do not put secrets, private API destinations or authorization rules in this
registry. Unknown hosts use safe defaults. Browser hostname detection is not
access control.

Use this order in the page head:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest" />
<script src="/domain-registry.js" defer></script>
<script src="/domain-config.js" defer></script>
<script src="/dns-diagnostics.js" defer></script>
<script src="/pwa.js" defer></script>
```

For `/portal/`, serve assets from that base and set `pwa.basePath` to
`/portal/`; use `./` for manifest `scope` and `startUrl`. The worker defaults to
its own directory and will not request a broader scope unless explicitly
configured.

## 3. Hosting headers and manifest route

- HTTPS is required for service workers, install prompts and push (except
  localhost).
- `manifest.webmanifest`: `Content-Type: application/manifest+json`.
- Host-aware manifest responses: `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, `Vary: Host`.
- `/progressier.js`: `Content-Type: application/javascript`,
  `Cache-Control: no-cache`. If it must control above its own directory, use the
  narrowest applicable `Service-Worker-Allowed` header.
- Set CSP `worker-src 'self'`; allow `https://cloudflare-dns.com` in `connect-src`
  for user-triggered diagnostics. Respect style nonce requirements documented in
  README.
- Do not put secrets in manifest/config responses; don't CDN-cache one host's
  manifest under another hostname.

Cloudflare Pages can use the included `functions/manifest.webmanifest.js`
adapter. It resolves a validated public registry entry for the request hostname,
uses safe defaults for unknown hosts, keeps manifest URLs same-origin and within
the app base path, and disables shared caching. On other edge/server platforms,
route the manifest URL to `YouGeManifestHandler.handle(request)` or implement the
same contract. A static JSON file cannot vary by request host; build one manifest
per host if the platform cannot execute a route.

## 4. Verify deployment

```bash
npm run check
node scripts/verify-deployment.mjs https://app.example.com
```

Verify:
- the manifest MIME type, identity, start URL and scope for that host;
- static icons and all scripts are present under the correct base path;
- worker path, scope and `Service-Worker-Allowed` headers are correct;
- no unrelated host or out-of-scope URL appears in manifest actions;
- CSP allows the worker and Cloudflare endpoint only when needed.

## 5. Browser acceptance

1. In Chrome/Edge DevTools → Application, confirm the host-specific manifest and
   active worker. Install and relaunch from the icon.
2. Test iOS Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen. Other iOS browsers may not offer
   Safari's manual flow.
3. Open `PWA.showNetworkDiagnostics()` and confirm the displayed hostname is
   this deployment's host. Diagnostics are on demand and do not block startup.
4. In a controlled test, enable offline mode and reload a visited route. The
   worker caches navigation HTML only when the response explicitly declares
   `Cache-Control: public`; confirm a public route or otherwise confirm the
   scoped offline page shows the hostname, retry action and recovery instructions.
   Mark authenticated/personalized HTML `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
5. Verify QR/share URLs use the active URL by default; test a waiting worker
   update if one is available.
6. Repeat on two separate origins and a subpath. Browser installs and local
   storage are intentionally independent per origin.

## 6. Optional push

Push still requires application-server authorization and VAPID keys. The
`examples/push-server/` sender is a demonstration, not production-authenticated.
Key subscriptions to the authenticated user and protect subscribe/send/delete
routes with your existing session middleware. Use your own contact address for
`VAPID_SUBJECT` and never expose a private VAPID key in this public registry.

## 7. Updating and rollback

- Keep `/progressier.js` at the same URL for the legacy worker to update in
  place. Keep legacy IndexedDB store names; saved share/notification data is
  not cleared by this upgrade.
- Worker caches now include host, registered app scope and version. The worker
  copies same-origin, in-scope static assets from the last known shared legacy
  cache names and migrates legacy HTML only when it explicitly declares
  `Cache-Control: public`. Old shared-name caches are retained because older
  versions did not identify ownership safely. It prunes only its own newer
  namespace; new navigation HTML is also cached only when explicitly public.
- Keep the legacy manifest ID on its original installation. Changing `id` can
  create a second installed app. Unrelated origins remain separate installs and
  cannot transfer browser data automatically.
- Roll back by restoring the previous runtime files while keeping the worker
  URL. Do not manually clear all Cache Storage or IndexedDB; this may erase
  user-visible history and shared payloads.
- Bump `VERSION` in `progressier.js` and `PWA.version` in `pwa.js` together for
  future cache-affecting releases.

## 8. DNS recovery

Diagnostics use Cloudflare's public DoH JSON API for the current hostname and a
same-origin app probe. They cannot inspect a device's ordinary resolver and
cannot prove ISP DNS blocking. Recovery remains user-guided: Android Private DNS
provider hostname `one.one.one.one`, or Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 DNS-only mode on
iPhone/iPad (no WARP required). See [`DNS_RECOVERY.md`](DNS_RECOVERY.md).
